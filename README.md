This project is related to Transportation System where we can fetch, insert, update and deleete trailer details like its origin, destination, trailer number, total packages from MySQL database.

1. Post API: We can insert data into MySQL database
2. Get API: We can fetch data of trailer based on id or all trailers from MySQL database
3. Put API: We can update data of MySQL database
4. Delete API: We can delete data from MySQL database
