# TransportaionSystem
This project is related to Transportation System where we can fetch, insert, update and delete trailer details like its origin, destination, trailer number, total packages from MySQL database.
Here, I have created Rest API's as below:
1. 	Post API: Is used to insert data into database
2.	Get API: Is used to fetch data related to trailer based on id or all trailers from database
3.	Put API: Is used to update data of database
4.	Delete API: Is used to delete data from database
